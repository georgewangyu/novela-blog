## Social Interaction

I feel like the entire education system needs a bit of an overhaul to include core classes like human interaction and computer science. Or just change the whole thing. Either or is fine.

Let me back up a bit.

It's 2 am. 

I'm half asleep with my head sinking into my pillow. 

But my mind is also running like a hamster on wheels. 

I want to get up, but it's also 2 am. It's weird how I like to write late at night. 

So I negotiate myself out of bed thinking it'll probably be fine the next morning. This is the exact moment where future George gets mad at past George for screwing him over due to lack of sleep.

But anyways, I'm up. I've had some recent curiosity for social structure and interaction. Why? I guess part of it comes from a chapter in Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality. The Draco and Harry beginning scene on their way to Hogwarts always gets me. Harry says: *"Draco has had tutors since he was little for this. Tutors for how to talk people and to manipulate people to control the world. SINCE HE WAS LITTLE."* The scene continues on where Draco and Harry try to mentally finesse each other to try to get the other person to reveal more about themselves. 

(*“Draco gave Harry a serious look. “One of my tutors once said that people form close friendships by knowing private things about each other, and the reason most people don’t make close friends is because they’re too embarrassed to share anything really important about themselves.” Draco turned his palms out invitingly. “Your turn?”*

*Knowing that Draco’s hopeful face had probably been drilled into him by months of practice did not make it any less effective, Harry observed. Actually it did make it less effective, but unfortunately not ineffective. The same could be said of Draco’s clever use of reciprocation pressure for an unsolicited gift, a technique which Harry had read about in his social psychology books (one experiment had shown that an unconditional gift of $5 was twice as effective as a conditional offer of $50 in getting people to fill out surveys”)*

Taken out of context it seems like really simple stuff, yet I would contend that these simple principles are hard to implement in real life. Think about the way most people interact with others. Are they for the most part winging it, or do they have some principles to guide them?

Also, I know it's a fictional story. Most of us aren't searching for ridiculous social power. Why would people try so hard to assert control, wouldn't that just make it really fake as well?

*(Okay reading this over the next part of my answer goes on a huge tangent and doesn't actually answer the question of whether or not being so manipulative or not. Maybe I'll answer this question another day but for now just follow the disjointed logic)*

However, I do think that social media is changing rapidly our social structure. The social zeitgeist is moving so fast that people are finding it difficult to adapt. Science and technology has eroded a lot of our belief systems from religion. I'm too lazy to find some statistics to back up my claims, but my intuition tells me that most people are lonely and are looking for better relationships, romantic or friendship wise. There are a couple of other points I want to add:

- All of us go through experiencing dumb s*** to figure out how to interact with others. Sure, our parents try to teach us. But particularly for immigrants, this may be difficult cause culturally it's so different for the kids and their parents.
- Social media makes it harder to make social connections because we have an unrealistic expectation for what life should be like
- **There is a dramatic decrease real life accidental run-ins and low-cost activities to meet people (I will explain this point further in later blogs)**

In essence, understanding interaction is essential, yet it is not taught very well. In a way, it is almost frowned upon to be super formulaic or strategic in social interaction. I remember Ali Abdaal saying something about how it's generally weird to try and optimize and schedule time for friends or to try and really write down about things to talk about. 

There are a couple of solutions I would propose at this moment:

1. Change the core courses in school to include principles of human interaction.
2. Create social media apps that provide **low cost activities** to enable to strangers to meet one another. 
3. Figure out how to include more **low cost activities** within company culture, enable more interdisciplinary profession hang outs.

Anyways I have a lot more to say about this but I'll just end it off here. Maybe next week I'll come up with some book list to read so that I can recommend it to others. Speaking of which...

## Book of the Week

Educated by Tara Westover is brilliant. From wikipedia so I don't have to summarize it:

- Educated (2018) is a memoir by the American author Tara Westover.
- Westover recounts overcoming her survivalist Mormon family in order to go to college, and emphasizes the importance of education in enlarging her world.
- She started college at the age of 17 having had no formal education.
- She details her journey from her isolated life in the mountains of Idaho to completing a PhD program in history at Cambridge University.
- She explores her struggle to reconcile her desire to learn with the world she inhabited with her father.

What impressed me most was how she never felt sorry for her situation and always looked to forgive the people around her:

*“That peace did not come easily. I spent two years enumerating my father’s flaws, constantly updating the tally, as if reciting every resentment, every real and imagined act of cruelty, of neglect, would justify my decision to cut him from my life. Once justified, I thought the strangling guilt would release me and I could catch my breath.
**But vindication has no power over guilt.** No amount of anger or rage directed at others can subdue it, because guilt is never about them. **Guilt is the fear of one’s own wretchedness”***

*Excerpt From
Educated
Tara Westover*

Anyhow, highly recommend if you are looking for a summer book to read!

## Debate Topic: if you could love only one person for your entire life, is that lucky or disappointing?

A couple days ago I was doing a team Chinese debate competition and the topic was: if you could love only one person for your entire life, is that lucky or disappointing? I was given the affirmative side: we were trying to convince the judges that loving only one person is a lucky thing. 

Felt like it was kind of a corny topic at the start, I also thought the affirmative side did sound wildly unrealistic. But I tried to roll with it. We eventually came up with some good debate points by defining what we thought love meant:

- Love **is** very hard to come by, so we should be happy if we even find it once in life
- Liking someone is different from loving someone. Love is unconditional and you don't expect anything in return
- The value of love also comes from the fact that **you're willing to say no** **to the options around you.** That's why it's incredibly valuable and lucky when you can say I loved someone and I was able to say no to everyone else
- Love **doesn't restrict** you from exploring your options. You can still see what is out there, yet you remain with the person you love because that's who fits you the best
- **Love doesn't just mean you love the qualities of the other person. You also have to love who you are when you are with them. That's why it is so lucky when you can meet someone you really love, because they reflect the best version of you (I'll touch on this a bit further)**

Anyways my mandarin is terrible, but overall the debate was fun. 

There's one portion of debate where you ask questions to the opposing side. I completely forgot about that part. 

The judge was like: "okay now's time for you to ask some questions to the opposing side". 

I was like:"f***. I totally forgot about this."

Needless to say, that probably didn't go over well.

Anyhow I digress, my concluding point in the debate was that the person you love is also a mirror of yourself. When you are with that person, you have to not only love them, but you must love the person that you are when with them. I think often times this goes unrecognized. Many times attraction starts by qualities that we admire about the other person, but we overlook how we feel about ourselves. 

I really think more emphasis in early selection of partners should be how much you can be your most authentic self with that person. I also don't mean that you can have the most fun with them, or any other singular positive emotion. How does your partner handle difficulties? Can you openly express hardships without feeling judged? Can you be yourself even in tough situations? I think those questions are just as important as the qualities you admire about the other person.

(Unfortunately, sometimes you try your hardest to make a relationship work, but it just doesn't because maybe you overlooked something during the process. Or sometimes things change that cause a disconnect. It's heartbreaking, but that's life. So much can happen, which is why to love only one person is really really lucky.)

*The "slow erosion of the self" is something that is hard to detect and sometimes the guise it tries to surface as is "compromise". Except when you look back you find you're the only one who has made compromises in the relationship.*

## Andy Murray

Somewhat appropriately, today I came across an Andy Murray post match interview where he cried talking about how much he loves tennis and how he's not ready to give up despite his hip injury. 

Obviously this is about love for a career, rather than a person, yet I still think there are good examples from this, even if you aren't a sports fan. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcRwAD-nbsM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcRwAD-nbsM)

Andy actually has a documentary detailing his rehab journey with his injury. You rarely see the behind the scenes of an athlete during their tough moments, so I definitely recommend this to any sports fan.

Anyhow, I rewatched his documentary that detailed his injury in the past few years, and I think it's a pretty good example of the points I was trying to make in my debate. The things I want to touch on are:

- Tennis might just be a sport to most of us, but not to these professional tennis athletes. There's a moment in the documentary where Andy talks about why he fell in love of tennis. It relates to the point I was making about how **you have to love who you are when you love someone or something:**

    *"You asked me a while ago why tennis was important to me. [At the age of 9] Our parents got divorced, and it's difficult time that, for kids to see that and not quite understand what's going on. Six to twelves months after that my brother also moved away from home, he went to train, to play tennis and...*

    *obviously we used to do everything together, so when he moved away, that was also quite hard for me. Kind of around that time and after that, for a year or so I had really lots of anxiety, but that came out when I was playing tennis. So a few times when I was competing, I would get really bad breathing problems. So my feeling toward tennis is that it's an escape for me in some way, all of these are stuff that's kind of bottled up. Because we don't talk about these things and they're not things that are discussed and....*

    *the way that I am on the tennis court I show some positive things about my personality and I also show the bad things, the stuff that I really hate. **But I feel that tennis allows me to be that child that has all of these questions and that's why tennis is important to me.***

- When you fall out of love, at some point you stop loving who you are when you are with them. **Andy expresses this because his injury and rehab was taking away his enjoyment of being a tennis player.**  However, when you love something or someone, there is an attitude of not wanting to give up no matter what. I always get emotional when I see stuff like this because it almost feels as if today love is so fickle, so it is always **beautiful to see someone really give it their all for something or someone.** When you're able to do that, even for a lost cause, it's almost feels like **a beautiful tragedy.** Everyone around you knows it is not going to work out. You yourself know in your heart it is not going to work out. But yet there's a period of time where everyone knows this but you just struggle to the very end.  (I also feel like a little b**** for not trying harder on the things I love). One day after practice, Andy's just sitting down with his trainers. They have a conversation:

*Trainers: How did you feel?*

*Andy: I got zero enjoyment out of that. Like I got zero enjoyment at all. Like none of it. The thing is like there is no end point, where I can say yeah, okay, brilliant, I can get back to competing. Everybody knows my hip is gonna be sore when I start playing again. I should be playing right now, but I'm not, I'm trying to protect my hip for f***ing nothing for no reason.*

*Trainers: Well you're short term is Melbourne right (Australian Open)? ... Say you said today that you were done [from playing tennis], how would you feel?*

*Andy: I would feel a lot better. At least I would know that there is an endpoint.*

**Just reading this transcript over, it just hurts even though they are having such logical communication. Everyone just knows it's done.**

There's a scene in the documentary that I would describe is **the emotional conclusion** to all of this. Andy Murray in his comeback plays a match at the Citi Open. He wins in third set tiebreaker. He goes back to his chair with a white towel over his head and **he starts crying. The commentators think it is because Andy is really happy to finally be competing again, and talk while Andy is sitting in his chair crying:**

*In many ways, it's a lovely shot isn't it. We've all certainly missed it. He's certainly missed. Incredible performance from Andy Murray.*

**But Andy isn't crying because he's happy about his comeback performance.**

**Andy is crying because he knows it is over.**

*I was really, really emotional at the end of the match, because I feel like this is the end for me. My body just doesn't want to do it anymore. I'm really sad about that, because I really want to keep going but my body is telling me, **"No."** I'm sorry [to everyone], but I can't keep going.* 

**F***, this to me is the emotional climax and I just feel heartbroken. Again, I feel like a b**** for not trying harder on the things I love, or giving up sooner the things I knew weren't right for me.** 

- Sports is unbelievable because it is one profession where you lose it when you are relatively young (mid 30s for most) and you essentially have to start over. **Many people talk about post-retirement being a rebirth of sorts where you find yourself again, much like what happens when someone gets out of long-term relationship. But sometimes, you need the bravery to step into the unknown and starting over.**

    *One the things that I'm worried and a little bit scared about it that if I do stop playing or I have to stop playing, that I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe it sounds ridiculous but I've always structure to my day. It doesn't matter how sick or injured I've been, I've never called up and said I'm not coming in today or if my hip or sore, "guys I'm not going to do today's training". That's something that I worry about, not having that structure. I'm sure lots and lots of athletes go through it as well. But it's just a very young age to lose something that you've done and you've had for your whole life. And I worry about that.*

Interestingly, the documentary ends on a high note because Andy breaks out of his rehab cycle by trying another hip surgery, where they literally put a metal ball into his hip. 

He says he is pain free after the surgery and hopes to play again. 

So I guess the lesson? **Have the bravery to give up or have the try something new in order to keep going.**
