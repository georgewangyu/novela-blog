You ever think about doing something, you discuss it, you think about the pros and cons, you dabble a bit in it, think it's fun and awesome, yet still never get around to doing it?
The idea of content creation at multiple levels has been in my head for a while. I think Ali Abdaal describes his fears and rationalization of blogging here, which also quite accurately depicts some of my thought process:
https://aliabdaal.com/fear-of-blogging/ <br />
In addition to his reasoning, I've also thought about the easiest barrier to entry for content creation. Blogging, making short-form videos, photography are all things that are fairly low barriers to entry. 
Does that mean they are less valuable, because anyone can do them? I've always thought that may be the case. Why do something that already has high supply for the demand?
Certainly blogging is nothing revolutionary, but it helps build momentum. You can't try and do something unique all the time, so I feel like these are the consistent things that will help maintain creativity during droughts. So for the most part it's a scrap book to help me settle my thoughts, but hopefully it may be useful to a couple of other people as well. 
With that being said, I'll probably have a couple of common themes that I usually want to touch on in the blog.

1. **Top reddit posts of the week in r/nba and r/soccer and maybe some other subreddits.** I probably would be scrolling through this sports stuff anyways. Even though the content is very oriented to sports fanatics, some of it is just hilarious and wholesome.
For example, last week this was a top post: 
Korkmaz and Thybulle from 76ers have next level chemistry so that they can even fake each other simultaneously.

2. **Book Club**: Okay this one might be a little inconsistent. I do read, but it's like all of the sudden I go on a reading binge and I read like 10 books in 2 weeks. Other weeks I would be lucky to get through baking instructions on the back of a box. 
3. **Coding**: I'll probably write about something coding-related as we go along.
This is probably just going to be a scrap book of thoughts, so we shall see how things progress from here. I'll give myself maybe an hour to write everything and edit, so I guess however much I can write in that allotted time.

With that being said:
### Reddit Post of the Week
**Chelsea are 2020/2021 Champions League Winner's**

Chelsea have won two champions leagues, both of them occurred after they fired the manager mid-season. I still don't know how their manager carousel somehow works effectively for them, but they've been winning, so congrats to them. 
A lot of my friends who don't really watch soccer ask me how to get started and my recommendation has always been to not watch just the Champions League final. The reason is that usually these games are very tactical and cagey affairs, very low scoring. That was the case in this  final (Chelsea won 1–0), but interestingly enough the game itself was very offensive. Guardiola decided not to have a sitting midfielder and went with a very offensive lineup, possibly in reaction to them having lost two straight games previously to Chelsea. In those games, Mount ran circles around Fernandinho, so I assume Guardiola was thinking about stopping Mount by pressuring him earlier up the pitch. Didn't really work though cause Mount got the turn on his assist for the goal.
If you want an exciting game, watch the second leg of a semifinal. Usually those games are super intense because you have a team trying to come back from a deficit. Makes it really intriguing when one team is going for it.

### Book Recommendation:
Foundation by Isaac Asimov. A very popular series and the basic premise of the plot is that a mathematician (Seldon) has figured out a way to predict the future of large populations using statistics. As a result, Seldon tries to limit a massive dark age that is coming by preserving science in two "foundation" settlements.
It's been a massively popular science fiction series for a long time, the reason I bring it up now is because there's an Apple TV series based on the book that is coming out in late 2021. 
Also controversial opinion, I prefer the prequels over the original series because you really get to uncover details about how Seldon comes up with psychohistory. 
The trailer seems quite insane:

### Coding: creating a website
Sure I could make my blog posts live on substack or medium, but I think a more permanent solution would be to just host this on ghost or netlify and also learn a bit more about html and javascript. 
<br />

**Day 1:** Initial setup of node.js, homebrew and netlify. One of my profs told me that it was a mindset change doing computer science from memorization to just googling everything and figuring it out from there. I totally agree and am finally starting to rewire my brain that way. Initially, for coding I thought at a certain point you just knew how to do most things. But I think I realized that pretty much everyone just googles their way through everything and follows tutorials.
<br />

**Day 2:** Got it set up on Visual Code Studio with Gatsby and React. Setting up some initial plug ins of Gatsby. I feel like setting up your environment is literally half the battle. MDX, one of the plugins, is Markdown for the component era. It lets you write JSX embedded inside Markdown. Apparently JSX is: "It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript." 
<br />

**Day 3:** Added the gatsby mdx plugin and sharp libary, which apparently helps with image processing. Google fonts plugin also added.
Scratch that.
I decided instead of doing the blog from scratch that I'm just going to use some starter theme. I end up using gatsby novela cause it looks quite cool and is very photography based.
3 hours in I just feel dumb. I took forever to setup. Then I watch this youtube live video of this guy setting up in environment, took him like 15 minutes. I also didn't realize .JPG and .jpg made a difference referencing a file and it took me literally forever to find that error (thanks to Irwin for helping me figure it out).

I think I've made the barebones for the site to be deployed. The only thing left is to buy a domain. 
<br />

I ended up getting an .me domain for now instead of .com, but it probably would me more professional at some point to switch to .com. Anyhow I have the basic infrastructure down, will work on the email listing maybe sometime later tonight or next week. That's it for my first blog of the week W1!
