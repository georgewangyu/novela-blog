## Playing A Character

If you look at actors or public figures, at times they over-emphasize character in their videos. I've thought about it yet I'm not exactly sure what type of "character" I should play, if I should play one at all. 

Things to think about when storytelling.

## Life Optimization

Okay so the blog is late this week, but the good thing is that I get to add a conversation I had with my friend Daniel today, which relates to what I was writing about all week.

I might be messing up the way Daniel explained the problem but essentially it's this: is there a way to better predict what we are good at and what career fits us the most? One idea Daniel mentioned was by measuring relative performance than absolute performance. An example: let's say it took me 2 hours to learn chess to a certain level and it took Daniel 10 hours to catch to me. Perhaps this relative performance can inform us that I am better equipped to play chess than Daniel.

After Daniel mentioned this, I suggested that there are other factors we should also consider. For example, this may be also a tortoise and hare situation. It may be true that I was better than Daniel at after 2 hours of learning chess. But what if I get bored after 2 hours and much like the hare, I stop trying? As a result, relative performance may be a difficult metric, given the variable of personal interest in an activity. There could also be the case where the curve is different for the two of us (like an algorithm). Maybe I used some brute force approach to get better at playing badminton, but my fundamentals sucked. The guy who has good fundamentals might lose to me at the start, but the more efficient algorithm (fundamentals) will win out as time goes on. We certainly see this in many sports. There are late bloomers who take years and years before they become the best in their profession. At a certain point, something just clicks. So basically there's no relative performance time limit that we can set, or perhaps it may be different for each profession and may only be really useful for professions where the progress is relatively linear. 

I should also mention that initial barrier to entry and learning curve may be different at the start for different people.

I continued our conversation by mentioning that maybe it doesn't matter if relative performance is the best metric. It certainly helps solve the problem that we may be over-reliant on absolute performance as a metric and that having a metric of relative performance is good because it provides another point of consideration. It's like when you first talk to someone, you probably will base your judgment of them on a number of different factors rather than just one. Daniel then mentioned how in certain physics concepts you can combine variables into one equation so that you can consider the whole thing in one equation. We agreed that we may be quite far from being able to do that at this point, initially we'd probably have these metrics separate and used one at a time, each as a reference point to consider.

I also mentioned that the question may also involve restriction free will. However Daniel astutely pointed out with less metrics you are unable to make an informed decision, meaning less free will. Makes sense.

So the reason I started with this conversation is because this is similar to an idea I was writing about earlier in the week. Instead of the inefficiency of choosing careers, I was wondering about the inefficiency of meeting people. 

The basics of the problem is this: we don't have a metric to help us choose friends. It's also very much dictated by somewhat uncontrollable external factors: geography, income status, school region, interests and randomness. So not much free will there. Yet if you think about it, this is very important, given we spend a large amount of time on the friends we have and our partner.

Also there's a lot of ways it can go wrong. Had a bad day when you met your potential soulmate? Didn't have confidence during a particular moment? The relationship is f—— right at the start just like if Mozart got bite by a mouse playing piano for the first time. Not a lot of free will there, you're just screwed. At least based on the current infrastructure in society. Wrong time wrong place is a true shame.

I like these true evil abstract ideas: time, genes, life inefficiency. Shows that there are a lot of fundamental problems we need to solve that affects everyone. 

As I write this, a part of my head is giving me these stupid platitudes like: you got to have the bad to appreciate the good... shut up. The zero sum mindset is just annoying and an unproductive mindset to any interesting thought process. It's like thinking: does anything really matter? 

Another part of my head is saying I should be careful when saying time, genes and life inefficiency are unambiguously evil... I get it. I also get the fact that the most ambitious goals which try to change something fundamental can also be very, very dangerous. I'm only contextualizing in this way to prove a point here. It doesn't contribute the debate if I just argue both sides at once. 

On a positive note, thinking about all the luck involved with meeting people makes me really appreciate friendships like the one I have with Daniel. We can just genuinely talk about stuff and wrestle with ideas, explore positions without any worry of offending each other. We can also take on different positions in an argument to allow interesting conversation, without turning it into a huge fight on who's right. 

So if you're reading this Daniel, which I assume you are, you're awesome and I appreciate a lot our friendship.

Anyways, I want to explore the meeting people inefficiency conundrum a bit further. 

This is the stuff I wrote earlier this week:

Just physically meeting someone is probably the most important thing that can happen in any relationship.

**The first reason** is obvious. If you don't meet them, there's pretty much no way a relationship can happen. Unless we're talking about about some online gaming virtual friendship I guess.

**The second reason** is a little less intuitive, but makes sense if you think about it. Physically meeting someone is actually an essential mechanism in building initial anchors of trust in a relationship. There's a book called Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language by Robin Dunbar which talks about how basic vocal interaction and gossip (small talk) helps establish identity. If you think about it intuitively, this makes sense right? It's a lot harder to trust someone online, because you don't really know if they're real. When you meet someone in person, it's a lot easier to read social cues. You could probably get to know someone so much easier by hanging out with them for a week than talking to the online for a year. That's also the reason many people say vacationing with someone helps you get to know them a lot, cause you're physically with them for an extended period of time.

There are more reasons on why the mechanism behind meeting people is important, but do I really need any more than the first two, heck even the first one? It's REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT, point proven, end of story. All of our best friends, partners, relationships, come from having to meet them first.

Okay now that we've established its importance, the next question is: is physically meeting people a random occurrence? If not, how much control do we actually have on the people we meet?

If you ask me, meeting someone for the first time is controlled by really dumb and actually a few unwanted external circumstances. 

Let's think about it a bit more.

When you're a kid, the people you meet is probably limited to your family's social circle and the friends you meet at school. As you grow up maybe that expands a bit to a few of the hobbies and clubs you do, but for the most part it is convenience dependent. 

Do we go to the same school? Cool, we might meet each other. Do we have similar hobbies? Cool, we might bump into each other during one of those things.

Because of this, it's not really random. Or only random within specific environments. If we were to pinpoint it to a couple of things, they would actually be:

1. Geographically dependent: Schools are based on living region and thus also segregated based on income level. The majority of someone's social circle have similar income levels, particularly at early on in life.
2. Hobby dependent: You know, this is kind of controlled by income class as well. There are certain hobbies that just cost more: like golf, skiing, hockey, poker, etc. These activities are in fact built in by society to initiate meet ups and spontaneous conversation for a certain subset of people, so you miss a lot if you're not doing some of these activities.
3. Social network dependent: Largely dependent initially on family, which is another income resource dependent thing.

So these three factors listed are largely controlled by financial class. I remember someone saying that it is hard for people to develop relationships with people 2 classes above or below them. Clearly we can see why here. 

Okay I might be over-emphasizing the income thing but bottom line is that there isn't actually a lot of free will when it comes to who we **get to meet.** Like I mentioned earlier, there's also a lot of ways for it to go wrong which is also out of our control: 

1. You had a bad day and you bumped into a potential soulmate on your way to work and you give them a terrible first impression. Game over.
2. You met someone who would be an awesome friend (complimentary strengths), but you forgot to discuss the initial common thread you guys had which is that you're both Harry Potter fans. Game over, you never see each other again.
3. You had a great day and you bumped into someone who doesn't fit you at all but you end up getting in a relationship with them. Meanwhile the next week you meet your soulmate but you can't break out of your new relationship. Game over.
4. You had a great week and while full of confidence, you start making friends with everyone and hanging out with more people. You miss out on your true best friend who is at home eating pop tarts waiting for you to discuss the recent Loki series ending hook. Game over.

Like Daniel says in his idea of career: how many Mozart's have we lost to tiny irritations when first hearing music?

When I think about this, I feel genuine sadness. Things could be more efficient, yet the majority of us are by ourselves or stuck in a less than ideal situation. So important, yet many of us don't consider the true mechanism of how we meet people.

So instead of a billion of the same romance songs, could we allocate some artistry to missed opportunities? Okay as I say this I do remember there are in fact many songs like this. Also Marvel is literally making their next phase of movies about alternate realities and timelines. 

**It'd be funny though to include Kanye's type of humour for his songs into the concept of missed relationships... maybe something like:** 

> I met my soulmate at Moraine Lake, but I was too hungry so I ate my cake.

(LOL at my attempt to rhyme quickly so I can continue the blog)

**Back to the original point I was trying to make: this is an important problem and right now we have inefficiency due to lack of control on the variables at play. Hence less free will.**

Lastly, I think this is an important discussion because meeting people has actually become even more **inefficient** in today's society. The problem is getting worse. COVID has caused us to stay at home more, meaning we meet less people in person. We are also less dependent of others, because we can just do everything by ourselves. We can have a great night ordering Uber Eats, watching Netflix at home and reading books online. Whereas years ago we probably would've met someone by sharing food with our neighbours, playing sports outside with friends and going to the library. 

Perception is also deceiving on social media, so we are more doubtful when we meet people. 

There is also disintegration of religion and cultural beliefs towards more independent thought, which can make it harder to find initial commonality.

**So it's an important problem, it is inefficient and it is getting worse. Less free will. Armageddon.** 

I'm going to suggest some potential solutions (there may certain be better ones out there):

1. Evolution of Social Media Apps: Okay this one is interesting and I have a lot of thoughts on this. I could probably write a couple blogs in and of itself on this topic alone (actually I already have written about this in my journal, just not posted). I will say that at this point we've only scratched the surface in how social media can help initiate physical meet ups. As of right now, the primary purpose of most social media apps is to just see how friends are doing or look at celebrity lives for a huge depression black hole. But I think social media can be more than that, surely the next step of its evolution is to help **facilitate** physical meet ups. And yes, I know things like Tinder and meet up apps exists. I just don't think they're very good at the "facilitating" part. I don't think they help build initial trust and help recommend who to meet very well. Sure it is good at one metric, giving us more options to pick using appearance. But again, like we mentioned earlier, over reliance on one metric like appearance is bad and we don't have very many alternative options. **I definitely want to take a crack at building something that adds a metric for people to consider and establishing initial trust, I have lots of ideas in this area.**
2. Evolution of companies that create meet up experiences: These exist already, but like social media apps I feel like they can do better. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure which direction to go on this. However, I think there may be too much emphasis on initial commonality between people.  Meeting people with less shared interests at the start is also important, but it is a lot more challenging to create such an environment. Anyhow, companies with concepts that reduce friction and awkwardness of meeting someone will become very valuable.
3. Removing investment cost of meeting people: physically meeting someone is actually a high investment activity if done purposely. People are busy, if you're going somewhere just for the sole purpose of meeting them, it is already high investment from both parties. There has to be a pretty good reason for doing so. That why it's incredibly difficult to break out of one's initial social network. Yes there are things like clubs and events that reduce investment cost by allowing you to meet a lot of people very quickly. But is it possible to reduce this initial investment cost further?
4. Changing community design: Daniel and I talked about this today as well. One issue that is very evident in North America is the lack of community. A reason for this is because car companies made cities very vehicle dependent. As a result, daily essentials are not within walking distance. On the other hand, I remember living in China as kid where everyone knew their neighbours because all the grocery stores, hair salons, book stores were within walking distance. You start bumping into people more often this way. There is more to it than that, such as culture, but I think a shift in community design would do absolutely wonders. Provide a walking based community with sharable electric vehicles that force people to talk or do an activity together, like community challenges, board game events, etc. It would do wonders for not only meeting people, but also community mental health.

(I want to add that a lot of times I feel people are like: "why think about this? Just meet a person organically, without forcing things. Go do the hobbies you want, and you'll meet a common social circle that fits well with you. It isn't rocket science." Fair enough.)

Going on a tangent. In regards to Daniel's idea of relative performance, I think another metric to consider is supply and demand of industry and careers. If we need more engineers rather than doctors, perhaps it would be wise to pick that as an career because there is less competition, hence your relative performance may just simply be better in an objectively smaller crop of people of supply based on demand. I will explore this more perhaps next week.

Thanks everyone, see you in next week's blog!
