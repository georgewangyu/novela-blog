Djokovic beat Nadal again at the French Open today. He is the only man to beat him TWICE at Roland Garros. That is absolutely insane.

Since Nadal's first French Open in 2005, he has play 108 matches in Roland Garros, won 13 French Open titles... and has lost a WHOPPING 3 matches. 

After 4 straight titles, he lost for the first time in 2009 to Robin Soderling where he literally got blown off the court by a once a life performance. Soderling literally had one of the powerful and flattest forehands at the time, so he managed play a match where he just literally overpowered Nadal's defense. That was also the year Federer finally managed to achieve his career grand slam by winning the French Open (this means winning all 4 major tournaments current in tennis). 

You may ask, why did it take him so long to achieve it? Well let's see, in 2005 Federer lost in the SF against Nadal. In 2006 he lost in the final against Nadal. In 2007 he lost in the final against Nadal. In 2008 he lost in the final against Nadal, where he got bagelled in the final set (which means you lose the set 6-0). Without Nadal, we could be talking about Federer as one of the best clay court players ever.

So that's how crazy it was for Nadal to lose back in 2009.

Nadal would not lose at Roland Garros for another 6 years, this time losing in the semi-final against Novak Djokovic. But even then, he was coming back from what I remember to be a long term injury, so he wasn't really playing his best at the time.

6 years later in 2021, he finally loses again. To the same opponent. Djokovic managed to beat Nadal. In the French Open. TWICE. 

I want reiterate again how good Nadal is in Roland Garros. There is literally a compilation of people saying how hard it is to play him:

I also remember vividly Federer beating Djokovic in an epic semi-final in 2011, ending his 41 match winning streak (Djokovic that year won 3 grand slams, and Federer gave that super cool finger wag at the end of the match)...

Only to get wrecked in 4 sets by Nadal. One thing that sucked about that match is I remember he was up 5-3 in the first set, and lost the first set 7-5. That was crushing.

Prior to the quarterfinal against Diego Schwartzman, Nadal had won 35 straight sets in the French Open. Diego is really tough, I remember him taking Nadal to 4 sets a couple years prior as well. **Basically what I'm saying is, when Nadal is on his game at the French Open it is literally an achievement to win a set against him there.**

Let's be clear here, Nadal has still beaten Djokovic more in Roland Garros. But how did Djokovic even manage win a match let alone two?

There are three main reasons in my opinion: 

1. **His flat forehand:** Djokovic likes a rising ball and is able to attack Nadal's looping forehands. Generally speaking most players don't really get over the ball and are pushed far back in the baseline in many exchanges with Nadal. It doesn't matter how good your previous shot is, Nadal can push you back in various positions by just hitting his looping forehand or backhand

2. **His movement to his backhand side:** The way he slides on clay going into his backhand is absolutely insane. Generally speaking when you are stretching for your backhand, you're basically putting right foot first. The problem with that is the recovery for the next ball is really slow, because you literally have to step you right foot back around and need to accelerate again in pretty much the opposite direction. Novak's movement to his backhand side is **left foot first at all times.** That's a huge advantage because the foot that is sliding is also the one that helps him accelerate and push off to reach the next ball.

3. **His new backhand down the line winner:** Novak's backhand down the line has always been good, but in the past few years that shot has been literally unplayable. I remember vividly during the final tiebreak against Federer in the 2019 Wimbledon final where Federer got killed by that shot:

    Boy.... watching part of that final is literally still traumatizing as a Federer fan (Federer lost 3 tiebreaks and was up a break in the final set and had 2 match points on his serve).

Other notes on the match:

1. Djokovic is the only person I know who changes the colour of his shirt during the match. This happened during the Australian open final as well. Might be some type of superstition, or something that he does to change the flow of the match. It's just a bit weird cause in most sports you don't really see a colour change midgame:

4. Diego Schwartzman Tweet:

Diego Schwartzman on Twitter : "Do we, tennis players, play the same sport as these two ?" (Novak/Rafa 2021 RG SF)

If you watch the highlights of the first SF today of Tsitsipas and Zverev versus the second semifinal, it is just crazy different the quality of tennis. That's just the reality currently, the big four (in particular the big three of Federer, Djokovic and Nadal) for the past two decades have just been way better than everyone else.

By the way ATP is terrible with highlights on youtube, they just don't want you to watch it and are incredibly stringent on other people posting highlights. The highlights they make are also super short, which is terrible. Just to note if any of my the video version of this blog get taken down, it's probably due to copyright.

### **Anyhow, quick Finals preview:**

Safe to say I'm betting on Djokovic, as much as I love Stefanos Tsitsipas. For those of you who don't know him:

- Tsitsipas has his own youtube channel, which he basically started around the same time after winning against Federer in the quarterfinal. Not a bad time to start your youtube channel
- Tsistipas backhand shot is too high and slow, Novak is probably going to attack it like crazy
- Tsitsipas gave Kyrgios number on Instagram hahaha

I think in order to when Tsitsipas needs to slice more on his backhand to change the rhythm. He needs to go for his winners and be as aggressive as possible. Overall, let's hope for a good final and may the best man win.
