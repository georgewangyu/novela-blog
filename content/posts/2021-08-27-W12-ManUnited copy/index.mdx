Ronaldo is back. Arsenal got Ben White. Man City don't have a striker. Today is a good day.

Before I get started on some serious analysis, let's show some of my favourite goals:

What a knuckleball free kick. And celebration.

One of my favourite games in the semifinal second leg.

Anyways, some serious analysis.

### What Ronaldo Brings To The Team

In the past few seasons, United have been really weak playing against a low block defense. Past managers like Mourinho have opted for a counter-attacking style rather than dominant possession play. After we bought Bruno Fernandes, this improved due to his creative ability in the attacking midfield position. Yet we are still lacking in several attacking phases of play that Ronaldo can help immediately:

1. Heading: For goodness sake, we have a very tall team but everyone is terrible or below average at heading the ball. Pogba is tall, but often times heads the ball too weak or off-target. Maguire is great at defensive headers getting it high up in the air but does the same thing offensively (to be fair he's slowly gotten better though). Rashford, Martial and Greenwood are average (don't get into good positions to head the ball though). Cavani last year helped solve some of these problems, but he is going to be off with the national team for next month or so. Ronaldo solves this problem. He is still very athletic, check out his header last year against Sampdoria:Â

2. Off-ball movement: After Ronaldo left Manchester United, he became a master at this. His off-ball movement is probably the best in the world, frequently getting tap-ins at Real Madrid (hence Tapinaldo). Along with Cavani, I hope he teaches the young guys Greenwood and Rashford how to move off-ball better. It's evident that in many instances, the young boys on our squad like the ball to feet more than movement to find space.
3. Set pieces: Ronaldo please, just let Bruno take the free kicks. Okay maybe take a couple of long ones for the memes, but that's it. Anyhow, our set-piece play has been terrible the last few seasons. We saw improvement against Southhampton with our delivery, but we had no finishing due to the heading issues mentioned above. Ronaldo will hopefully solve this problem.
4. Work Ethic and Spirit: It is no longer a project. We are here to win the Champions League. Ronaldo will raise the spirit and belief of any team in that competition. His work ethic is also unparalleled and this will help change the dynamic of the locker room.

There are also some things I am concerned about:

1. Age: He's getting up there in age so it remains to be seen how long he can keep his goalscoring ability up. His chronic knee injury remains a concern, which has affected his overall dribbling and ability on the ball throughout his later career. Ole needs to rest Ronaldo properly to get the best out of him.
2. Ego: Hopefully he lets the younger guys shine as well with a fluid movement offence, rather than being the main target man so that he can get his goal tally up. One of the reasons Ole chucked Lukaku was because he wanted a fluid front 3 where all 3 could get in on the goals rather than having an out-and-out striker. Ronaldo can definitely do this, as he has done most of his career on the left-wing. I just hope that he still has enough stamina to move around the wings and play interchangeably with the young guys.

### Manchester United Title Ambitions

Okay highly controversial, but I kind of understand Ronaldo's motives for going to City, if the rumours were true. He's trying to catch up to Messi in Ballon d'Ors and the only way he's going to be able to do that is to win the Champions League. Man City has never won the Champions League, but I have to say at this moment it can't be disputed that they have a stronger squad than us. They were missing a striker and Ronaldo fits the puzzle perfectly. Ronaldo ended up not doing this most likely due to legacy reasons with United. But from a winning standpoint, it is hard to argue that City would've been a better choice.

However, this doesn't mean United can't win. Let's evaluate our Champions League chance pragmatically.

My current evaluation is that we are still missing a world-class defensive midfielder (DM). I'm not sure who is available in the market, but it is a huge disadvantage for us that our rivals have very good to world-class DMs (Liverpool with Fabinho, Man City with Fernandinho and Rodri, Chelsea with Kante and Jorginho). Not only do our rivals have great DMs, but they also have very fantastic ball-controlling midfielders (like Jorginho). Ever since we lost Scholes, Giggs and Carrick, we have had a massive hole in our midfield at that pivot position. Unless we can solve this problem, I still have doubts regarding our defensive stability and possession game. Defensive and deep-lying controlling midfielders I feel are even harder to find than strikers. Hopefully, we can identify someone for the January window and upgrade our midfield.

Overall I would say that this year it is unlikely that we have a chance at winning the Champions League, but you never know. It is well known that Ole is also really bad with in-game adjustments and substitutions. Hopefully that improves, or else we will be outmaneuvered during the knockout stages.

The way I see our style of play, it is still predominantly a very fast-paced transition attack with Fred and McTominay winning the ball back quickly to recycle possession. We will have still have issues with low-block teams and will probably do better against bigger sides who play very ball-dominant.

For those reasons, I hope we avoid solid defensive sides like Atletico or an Italian team in the Champions League. As long as we play against teams with a more expansive style of play, I think we have an advantage due to our rapid transitions.

### Strength of the Premier League

As predicted, the financial might of the Premier League has dictated that England is now far and away the strongest league in the world. I don't see this changing anytime soon, given how badly Spain and Italy have messed up their marketing and tv rights deals. One of the reasons Madrid was so desperate for the Super League was because they were in a terrible financial situation. Same with Barcelona (look at the Messi fiasco). I can't see it getting better in the near future, unless they somehow figure out how to make the Spanish League more entertaining amongst the weaker sides.

But boy, this makes the Premier League so tough this year. Every side is crazy good. Chelsea won the Champions League last year and loaded up further with Lukaku and Kounde. Man City got Grealish so their midfield is even more stacked. Liverpool signed a young centre-back. But the most important thing for them was to keep all their players, which they have. Manchester United got Sancho, Varane and Ronaldo.

I am hyped for the season, as this promises to be quite the battle up at the top.
