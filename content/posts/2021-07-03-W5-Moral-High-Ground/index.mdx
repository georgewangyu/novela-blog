## People's Moral Compass With Money

How much does money come into consideration for career decisions?

I remember JAY-Z once said in an interview that he struck a good balance between making good artistic music and also getting paid for his art. He was not just good at music, but also good at the **music** **business.** 

He also mentioned a lot of so called "pure" artists "hit you with a I'm only doing this for the art" to try to stand on some moral high ground or to try and demean the artists playing the **music business** game.

You see this argument everywhere really. Steve Jobs often talked about how they don't "ship junk" as a reason for why Apple didn't care about personal computer market share (at the time dominated by Microsoft). This was another moral high ground stance on substance over money. Alex Ferguson in his autobiography talked about how he felt David Beckham lost out on his true life mission because he pursued fame over football. Moral high ground stance.

Honestly, I see both sides of the argument. But for whatever reason, I feel like I hear the substance over money argument quite a bit. So I'm going to try to argue for the other side a little.

1. Being creative enough to appeal to the masses is really tough. A lot of times people misconstrue this as just finding the simplest most common denominator that everyone can related to, which takes no skill at all because it isn't breaking boundaries. I sometimes wonder myself if the work I want be doing is playing with a very safe palette. But many times you have to be creative enough to wrap complicated things around something easily understandable to everyone. That is incredibly difficult. Pretty dumb metaphor but imagine a circle of knowledge. There are people pushing the circle to make it larger by creating spikes, and there are other people who have to take those spikes and conform it back into a larger circle.
2. One has a responsibility to decrease barrier to entry to their field as much as possible. Many times researchers try to make their work sound more complicated not because it is actually difficult. The barrier to entry is created to make their work sound more valuable. Barrier to entry can be decreased by generating basic interest in the simple things within a particular field. Sure I can't play tennis like Roger, but I can sure enjoy a tennis match. I'm not sure the same can be said for various scientific fields as they have gotten killed in the marketing department. 
3. There is a level of arrogance for one to think that the work they are doing is only reserved for a select few people who truly understand it. 
4. Just because something is not easily understandable, it doesn't mean you can't add an entertainment piece to it. When I watch a basketball match, I might not know all of the complicated coaching strategy. But you know what? They work really hard to make an entertaining product to casual fans. Many times people are just unwilling to do the work to create the entertainment storytelling piece, which is really really hard.

In the end, are the decisions we make sinning or contributing? Nobody knows. Not me, nor that billionaire, or that artist.

Speaking of which, this somehow reminded me of...

## Underrated Album of the Week: 808s and Heartbreak by Kanye West

Kanye West is the best when he spews out the funniest self-deprecating or extreme lines. In one of the songs Welcome to Heartbreak he says:

*My friend showed me pictures of his kids, And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs, He said his daughter got a brand new report card, And all I got was a brand new sports car*

Okay maybe this isn't the best example...

But anyhow, an interesting album especially considering the time it was put out, where the snare drum style wasn't really that popular yet. 

## Three Act Structure in Storytelling

Basically the basic structure in most stories have a setup, confrontation and resolution. Sounds simple enough but in practice it is really difficult to do it in a vlog or any video. You have to think about pacing, the scenes you want, the b-roll footage, etc. Particularly if you're trying to film daily activities, it's really difficult to come up with a setup, conflict and resolution on the spot. 

The question for me though: is it really necessary to maintain a 3 act structure for vlogs? Life is like a car crash, there is no stable beginning, middle or end. If you look at Dobrik's vlogs, his style reflects this very well, where he goes from one scene to the next. In a way, it is almost like multiple condensed 10-30 second stories all fit into one vlog. 

## Book of the Week

**A People's History of the United States** is a history book by American historian and political scientist Howard Zinn. If you're up for a very serious summer read, I would say that this book is for you. It doesn't really cover the traditional story beats of American history, instead this book talks more about historical events that are largely ignored in high school curriculums (although I've heard that this book is being taught in lots of high schools now).

I have a very vivid memory reading this book by myself on some park bench in Paris. During my first year summer, I kind of went on a solo trip across Europe for a week. I remember that by the time I got to Paris I got really really sick. Basically I spent most of the day just reading this book and then finally convincing myself that I needed to go outside because I was in freaking PARIS. 

Anyhow, highly recommend for those who have time to go through a pretty big book.
