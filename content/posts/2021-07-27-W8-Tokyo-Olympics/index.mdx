So the Olympics started. I think there is definitely not as much hype, at least for me, coming into these Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Makes sense given the pandemic. 

It also might be because I'm old. When I was younger I remember how excited I was for the Beijing 2008 opening ceremony, because it felt so rare for the Olympics to be happening. I was looking at the medal count everyday, "Oh China won a gold! Oh Canada won something today. Oh swimming/track and field started so the USA is just racking up the medals."(By the way there is heavy inequality in the number of medals within swimming compared to other sports, literally a medal for every stroke). 

Whereas now, I've pretty much seen everything already multiple times so I know what to expect. The opening ceremony is not as exciting and feels more drawn out than anything. The commentary sometimes sucks cause some of them don't really know the sport they're talking about. There's no audience this year cause of COVID. All things I might've overlooked when I was younger. 

BUT, there are still many interesting sports and themes I've been following. For example...

## Table Tennis

China dominates this field. We've had a clean sweep of the medals in the last 3 Olympics and I think the stat is we've won 25 out of 27 golds since table tennis became an Olympic sport. Because of this, they've had to change many rules to try and stop the Chinese domination in the sport. For example, only 2 players can enter the singles tournament per country. If there wasn't a limit on this, literally the top 15 players could be from China. They also changed the ping pong ball to a slower polyball after London 2012. Despite these changes, China still wins pretty much every time. 

Well, until yesterday. Liu Shiwen and Xu Xin lost to Mima Ito and Jun Mizutani of Japan in the Mixed Doubles Final. The Chinese pair had a 2-0 lead before losing 4-3. 

I know China wins every time but I felt sad for Liu Shiwen specifically. In the last 2 Olympics, she didn't get picked to participate in the singles event (because of the 2 per country limit). Finally in 2019, she wins the World Championship and is on course to be selected this time around. She gets an elbow injury, plays poorly in the Chinese Trials, loses her spot to two other very capable teammates. Recently I watched her interview with 鲁豫 （basically the Oprah of China). She said that for a period of time she was thinking of giving up cause younger players were getting better than her. To comfort herself she had two options of crying. One was to cry late at night with the covers over her so no one can hear. But then she realized logistically it was a bit difficult. She had to get tissues so her teammate who's rooming with her may notice. 

> Her other option was to cry in the shower, so that the running water dampens the sound of tears.

All to put out a strong front and not have to burden others with her tears. Then post-match Liu Shiwen was crying about losing the final and honestly it was pretty gut wrenching.

But that's sports. It's so rewarding but also painfully cruel. 

Big picture wise she's still a World Champion and one of the best players in the world. There are many many table tennis players who would trade positions with her. I also think it's good for the sport that other countries win so that there is more popularity globally.

Speaking of popularity and commercializing a sport as entertainment...

## Developing Young Audience Interest in Table Tennis

This is a fascinating problem. Liu Guoliang, the head coach of the Chinese team, talked about his challenge of continuing their international success competition wise as a top priority. Following closely behind, he stated that Table Tennis can be better commercialized and better packaged as a product. His basic strategy is:

1. In the National Trials, develop the product for entertainment purposes, very much in a pop start concert way (players being the main stars). 
2. Letting players show their personality. Liu Guoliang talks about how when Zhang Jike ripped his shirt off after he won his first world title he thought it was good and bad. Good because kids enjoyed it. Bad because it's disrespectful to the opponent so he has to be punished for it. 
3. Letting players do entertainment shows. Develop them as stars.

It's pretty cool to have a head coach who is progressive. Also interesting how he walks the fine line of entertainment and the militant respectful nature of Chinese culture. 

Because of this, it may hard to replicate certain aspects of the United States model, such as the NBA. For one, it's an individual sport, so you can't really do a league where players move between teams. It may also be difficult to replicate the narratives NBA uses for players to create rivalries. 

It'll be interesting to see how this develops. For USA, it has gotten to the point where the Olympics don't really matter as much for them because the players care more about an NBA championship. They also make way more money obviously as a part of a league.

So big picture wise, I think the medals are important, but I also think developing the sport for entertainment is probably even more vital.

### Very briefly: Some other Sports

1. Basketball: USA might actually lose this year. They have so many iso players, not enough size and role players to space the floor. They're the favourites but for the first time in a quite a while they are vulnerable.
2. Air pistol: Interesting sport. Not very athletic but they look so cool just like putting a pistol towards the target with that serious look on their faces.
3. Badminton: China still has the advantage in most disciplines, but lots of parity among the countries now. Mixed doubles the two Chinese teams are clear favourites and will most likely win gold and silver. In all the other disciplines there is a fair bit of competition so will be interesting to see how it plays out. I say the China wins 3 out of 5 golds, Japan will probably win a gold in Women's doubles or Singles, and maybe Indonesia will win in Men's Doubles.

## Book of the Week: Dune

A movie is coming out on this by one of my my absolute favourite directors, Denis Vilaneuve. He made Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival, two of my favourite movies. I'm very interested in seeing how he directs the movie, as I think various aspects of the book are very difficult to show on film. Highly recommend for the summer!

See you guys in next weeks blog!
