It's amazing how people who are passionate about a particular thing can turn their curiosity blinders up for everything else. You hear about these stories of geniuses at their craft who don't know how to boil an egg, fold their clothes, stuff like that.

Even the other day, I heard about how Tony Leung didn't know how to turn his tv on. (By the way for those of you who don't know about Tony Leung, I'll give a bit of an introduction later in the blog.)

For me at least, these curiosity blinders do not exist. So I actively try to avoid becoming curious about certain topics that take up my time.

Unfortunately, sometimes things happen that pique my curiosity.

For example, skincare. Seems like a huge pain to have to do every day.

But I was talking to someone the other day and they were like, "your eyebrows need to get waxed on the sides."

And I was thinking, whatever not a big deal. I don't care enough about this.

A couple of minutes later she said,  "you're starting to get some wrinkles on the top of your face!"

In the beginning, I was like who cares? It doesn't even matter. A natural part of aging and not particularly noticeable.

Then the next day while I was brushing my teeth I was in front of my mirror. I leaned forward. Got closer to the mirror. Took a look at the deep complexions of my face.

And I was like s—-, I do have wrinkles.

Back to my work desk.

Went to my laptop.

I started googling different types of wrinkles and how people take care of their skin.

Anyways in this particular case, I stopped myself from getting too much into the topic and becoming a wrinkles expert. I still don't care enough to do all that skincare routine stuff.

Then later this week I kind of got into cars.

I wanted to get a car for the winter season for skiing and snowboarding.

Within a week, I turned from someone who knew absolutely nothing to kind an expert.

So as much as I like the appearance of some of those German cars, I went more practical. Maybe in the future when I have more time and disposable income I'll get back into it.

So for me, it takes effort to try and actively avoid certain things that pique curiosity. You open that can of worms it becomes hard to close. I suppose those childhood geniuses, they find the most comfort in their passion so they never venture far enough to be curious about something else.

For me at least, active avoidance is the best policy for certain things that are huge time consumers.

### That Shang-Chi Movie

I'm quite excited to watch this movie. First, let's get the negative stuff out of the way. This movie is probably going to introduce some martial arts sequences which may be seldom seen within Hollywood, but probably quite common in Chinese Kung Fu movies. Although I am optimistic, I'm not convinced the action sequences are as good as what the reviewers are saying. Second, this movie will most likely follow the typical Marvel formula. Existential journey for the hero, loses the first battle, then redeems himself in some huge action sequence at the end. Most of Marvel's origin films have this cookie-cutter formula. Not as interesting when you pretty much know that the end of the film is going to conclude with some big CGI action sequence. Yes, this is not exclusive to just Marvel and is typical for all action movies. I just think we've gotten to the point where there should be more experimentation out of these films.

Alright now that we've gotten the negative stuff out of the way, let's get to the positives.

Tony Leung.

Ever since I watched his performance during **In the Mood for Love**, I've been enamoured by his ability to act with great subtlety and nuance. If you watch his earlier films, he was already a great actor, but he did it by letting you know exactly what he was feeling through facial expression. As he progressed, his performance shifts slowly from the clear delineation of emotion to subtlety through eye movement. As the audience, you're left guessing how he's feeling. He's portraying characters with deep emotional conflict and you can see it in his eyes. It's incredible how many scenes there are of just Tony Leung standing around, looking at the distance. You see his eyes, and it leaves you feeling the magnitude of his character's internal conflict. The power and emotion expressed in his eyes is incredible. I hope to learn a bit of that in the future.

I truly feel in Shang-Chi we're going to get one of the best and most nuanced Marvel villains to date. His presence in the film is enough to watch this movie.

This of course brings the question of whether Simu Liu, the main protagonist, can match the acting chops of his counterpart and father in the movie. So far from I've heard the reviews are good. I'm optimistic that he can deliver a great leading role performance.

I'm excited that Simu as a leading man is a Chinese immigrant who understands the current perception of Asians in western media and what he would like to change.

Yes, sometimes he is very outspoken. Yes, he may get it wrong sometimes by fighting the wrong battles and speaking too loudly on certain subjects. But he may be exactly what we need because I feel at times Asian-Americans are not outspoken enough. So I love that he is our lead and is speaking out on what he thinks is right. It'll be good for us in the long run, even if he makes mistakes on some of his takes.

Let's hope for a good box office return despite COVID. Excited about the movie next week.

See you all in next week's blog!
