# W14- The Ultimate Guide to Career Planning

I had no idea how to pick my career in high school. Career fairs were just an excuse to not do work on a school day.

I wasn’t old enough to drink, yet I’m expected to pick the work I wanted to do for the rest of my life?

Career choice is especially problematic because nearly everyone falls into the trap of sunk-cost fallacy. For those who don’t know, by definition sunk-cost fallacy is a phenomenon whereby a person is reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action because they have invested heavily in it, even when it is clear that abandonment would be more beneficial. We feel we have committed to a choice, whether good or bad, because there are hand cuffs that prevent us from changing course.

I fell into this trap. As a high schooler, I wanted to be a doctor. So I committed to three years of biology classes in high school. I also committed a lot of time volunteering and working at a hospital. By the time I made it into university I realized I made a mistake but was trapped in the sunk-cost fallacy. Even after making a successful transition as a software engineer, I sometimes still think one of these days I’m going to go back and complete medical school. It’s as if I am desperate on completing some side mission to justify previously pursuing a path that did not become my career.

As a result, I want to unpack the thought process I should’ve taken in order to make a more informed decision.

### Your Career Is Different From Your Passion <a name="ultimate-guide"></a>

I could’ve gone to the NBA. One of my biggest regrets is not being Jeremy Lin or the first Chinese English Premier League Footballer. Every once in a while I think to myself: what am I most passionate about? Sports. What am I able to do for hours and hours and still enjoy that activity? Sports. What could I do every day that I don’t need to be motivated for? Sports.

So why is being an athlete not my career?

Because being passionate about something does not equal a career. A career is something you can monetize. A passion is a hobby, unless you can find a way to monetize it. Now truth be told, I probably could’ve been a decent athlete. But I neither had the infrastructure or exceptional talent at the time to pursue a sport. There are certain professions where you can be average and make a decent amount of money, but in sports you are either one of the best making millions, or you suck. Most casual fans typically watch top tier leagues, and nothing below that. Money making in sports is monopolized by the few truly talented athletes in their respective sports.

The reason I bring this up is because a common theme I remember that career fairs tell students is to pursue their passion. I think people misunderstand this to be an essential for a career. There are quite a few problems with this thought process:

1. A passion may not be as fun as a career. Perhaps I would feel differently being a professional athlete, because the business of sports is different from playing sports. One must first guarantee they enjoy the business of whichever passion they pursue.
2. A passion can only be a career if you find that you can monetize the business of this particular passion. If you can’t monetize your passion, it cannot be a career.

**Do not use passion as the only metric for career choice.**

### Pick a Career Where You Can Gain the Most With the Least Amount of Work

So what should your career choice value system be?

Quick example. If tomorrow, every single teddy bear manufacturer disappeared from the face of this earth and nobody except me could become a teddy bear manufacturer, I’m sorry but I’m quitting my job and becoming a teddy bear manufacturer.

Career choice when it comes down to it is quite simple. Pick the career where you have the most talent in, with the least amount of competition, and has the most demand, and one where you can make the most money.

**Personal talent, competition, demand, money/rewards.** 

At the end of the day, career is really just a supply and demand economics question with a personal talent variable placed in it.

For example if I was Lebron James in high school, I would look at this problem like this:

Becoming a basketball athlete:

1. Talent: Most talented player ever coming out of high school. He is in the top 0.00001 percent of the basketball industry.
2. Competition: Every sport has huge competition because most people play sport at a young age. The competition is extremely high in the NBA, however because he is the most talented, this competition does not matter.
3. Demand: The basketball industry has tremendous demand for top tier athletes only.
4. Money: Millions of dollars as a top tier athletes, very low salary for anyone else.

Playing basketball makes sense for Lebron because he is one of the most talented player ever. The decision to be an athlete is much harder for the average person because competition and demand is so high in this industry.

Each industry will provide each provide each person different answers to the question of how much they can realistically gain with the least amount of work. As a result I would first evaluate each industry by personal talent, competition, demand and money. This eliminates common fallacies where one picks a passion they are talented at, but finds no money or heavy competition in the industry. 

A couple of tips on each of the variables: personal talent, competition, demand, money/rewards.

### Personal Talent: Know Your Unfair Advantage

If you’re rich, you afford to take more risks in non-traditional paths.

If you’re talented and very hard working, you can pick careers that are more competitive.

If you’re good at specific subject, you can leverage this for your side hustle.

By knowing your talent, you can put this into the supply and demand equation mentioned above to assess your options.

### Competition and Demand: Try to Find Careers with More Demand than Supply

Simple question, many students go into science looking to become doctors. There is **more supply** than jobs available. What do these students who don’t get into medical school do? They go into graduate school for science. Certain careers have over-saturation while others don’t. For example, in the early 2000s up until now, the tech industry has continued to grow and there is more demand than there is supply. Try to identify industries with less supply than demand.

### Money/Rewards: Typical Early Career Path

Lucy Guo once said for early tech career advice:

1. Intern or work 6-12 mo at a big name company (can be private)
2. Join a Seed-Series B startup. Email VCs asking for their top portfolio companies - they have insider knowledge.
3. Repeat (2) or start your own company.

This is applicable for most career choices as it offers a balance between risk and reward. The big name company early on ensures security and an increase in options, while the start ups offer greater risks but more rewards.

### Pick Careers that Open Up More Options

Some careers are naturally more restrictive and resistant to allowing flexibility in the career ladder. For example, although possible, it’s much more difficult to go from being a physician to a hedge fund manager than it is from a consultant to a hedge fund manager. Certain career experiences create unique stepping off points to other opportunities. Many of these are at big brand name companies such as FANG, Big 3 consulting, top investment banking firms. 

### Traditional Career Paths Are Lowest Risk (Sometimes)

For the majority of people, they will consider these careers:

1. Engineering
2. Medicine
3. Software Engineering
4. Business
5. Law
6. Science

I use the word “traditional” because these industries have a clear career path. Each have their own game, but the rules quite simple and easy to determine.

For example, when becoming a doctor, the main game you’re playing is to get amazing grades to get into medical school. This is because the competition is incredibly intense in getting into medical school if you live in the US or Canada. The game is to get into medical school because the number of jobs is limited by the one main employer, the government, and they control the number of seats available, which is heavily limited. Because it is not a public industry, every year there are way more applicants than people who get into medical school. **The game is quite simple: if you are a good enough student and can play the grades game well, then you have a major advantage to getting into medical school. Becoming a resident and physician salaries are publicly documented, with a quick google search you can see the salaries of a resident and how many years it takes to become a doctor.** It is a low risk profession resistant to recessions, however highly competitive in terms of applicants to medicine. 

Other traditional careers are similar in that there is very well defined path. Law and Medicine belong in the high GPA category and high demand on getting in as an applicant. Engineering, business, science are also very grades driven, but also have an internship/work experience component that is heavily emphasized. Software engineering at this point is less grades driven, placing more emphasis on project and internship experience. 

They are the lowest risk because at every point of the career ladder you have a pretty good idea of where you are in the career ladder. Compared to if you wanted to be, let’s say a YouTuber in the early 2000s. The industry hasn’t been there long enough to provide input on what the career path for most Youtubers look like. So there is more risk but potentially more reward.

I want to conclude by going back to the sunk cost fallacy:

I recently read Simu Liu’s book and he said:

“It seems like such a paradox to me that human beings are both great adapters to change and terrified by it at the same time. So often we drift through life bound by the poor decisions we’ve made in the past, too afraid of the uncertainty that comes with challenging our status quo. We find ourselves stuck on a ship that is headed full speed to a place we’re pretty sure we don’t want to go, but we also don’t want to deal with the discomfort of jumping. So we say nothing, watching helplessly as we sail toward our doom like silent prisoners of our own past.”

Excerpt From
We Were Dreamers
Simu Liu

The most difficult part of career path is making changes when we’ve made the wrong choice. When faced with new information, we are always resistant to the commitment we made to ourselves as a high schooler, as if that high schooler was some genius and had amazing reasoning when picking the career. When you feel you are resistant, the tip regarding slowly making the switch is probably best in help this change feel most natural.

### You Can Mitigate Risk For Careers that Have Non-Traditional Paths

If you want to pursue a non-traditional career path, I think a great way to do so is by balancing this with a traditional career up to the point where you can afford to make the switch. I think lots of times people feel like they need to make the switch right away. But a lot of times you can start by doing the creative side hustle in your spare time and working on this until there is a viable money making method in the side hustle.
