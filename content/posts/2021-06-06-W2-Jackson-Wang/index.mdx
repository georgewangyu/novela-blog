**Day 1:** Today I want to talk a bit about a music video that was recommended to me, **LMLY** by Jackson Wang. 

First watch: Clearly there's some heavy Hong Kong cinematography influence (wow I can actually put into use my Chinese film class knowledge). It reminds me of one of my favourite movies, In the Mood For Love in terms of shot setup. Funny enough, the content of the video has some similarities as well.

The way I would explain it (I don't know the technical terms for these shots), but there's lots of frames or corridors that restrict movement (I think back in the day it was to contextualize lack of space in Hong Kong). The camera has lots of tracking and trucking shots to establish the scene and everything is really smooth. 

He definitely does some interesting transitions that are obviously not used for movies, and are more music video style. I would've omitted the bowl transition cause it breaks you out of the movie feeling he's trying to achieve, but it's kept at a minimum which is good.

Overall, the shots are all really well done, I like the video.

Second watch: I'm dumb, I didn't even realize this on the first watch, but essentially the romance is all in his imagination. Jackson is a dishwasher and the girl he loves at first sight already has someone else, and the romance is in his head.

Going through the shot list again, we have: 

- camera tracking shot to set the diner scene (I don't know what it's called when there's no subject)
- music video esque transition
- pull out shot to show Jackson's work environment
- static shot to show the girl and Jackson, series of push in and arc shots of girl and guy to emphasize romance (like push in of that work environment shot again with the girl)
- a variety of arc and tracking shots montage
- **climax of imagination and official reversal of shots of reality**
- We have the other guy come in and its a series of push in shots of Jackson alone with the girl in the distance, showing that he was imagining it all
- cool music video esque whip pan transition
- and then back to tracking shots and the end scene of girl married to other guy.

Damn. That definitely hurts.

It's definitely well executed to show Jackson's imagination with the girl. 

Overall Review**:** I would say that this is an extremely well shot music video with some pretty sweet Hong Kong cinematography included that gives the sort of claustrophobic and restrictive nature that works well with the type of romantic video Jackson is going for. He's a dishwasher, you really feel how **restricted** he is and the position he's in. 

One thing I would add is that I feel that there are so many romance songs, it's so hard to be original now. Songs about breaking up, not getting girl/guy, redemption arcs, love stories, revenge, rivalry in romance, girl has another guy, you name it. It's all been explored extensively in songs. So I like the fact that there's a mixture of some Hong Kong cinematography mixed in.

Jackson also looks way too good, like he does not look like a dishwasher, where there are stains on his shirt everywhere. There's no way that his shirt is all white.
