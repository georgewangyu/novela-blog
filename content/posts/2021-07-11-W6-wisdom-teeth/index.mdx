## Wisdom Teeth Surgery Experience

Okay so I got all 4 wisdom teeth removed this morning. I'm going to document this whole experience for anyone who's looking get their wisdom teeth removed in the future and are curious about the process. 

I decided to go with an oral surgeon instead of my dentist, as they can do surgery with general anesthesia for the removal (dentist's usually just give you local sedation and pull them while you are awake). The benefits are that the wounds are not as big (I think, so less risk for infection), there is less inflammation, your muscles are relaxed when you are under, and the procedure is pretty straight forward, so you can get all 4 removed at the same time (usually the dentist can only remove 2 at a time maximum). The cons are that you get a bit of a headache post-procedure from the anesthesia, it's also a lot more expensive to get it done from an oral surgeon (was like over 4000$ without insurance, plus an initial 100-200$ consultation fee).

## Pre-operative Instructions

- **Absolutely NOTHING to EAT or DRINK (including water) after midnight on the evening prior to surgery.**

We have this place in Calgary called Wow Chicken which has some pretty awesome fried chicken. I decided to get some of that before the procedure, because post surgery it's pretty much soft foods for a week. 

- If you take routine oral medications, check with oral surgeon prior to your surgical date for instructions

I took some anti-histamines the day before and the doctor said it was fine.

Apparently I'm allergic to cats (something I found out a couple years ago). 

My sister has wanted a cat for a while, so they got a cat last year at the family house. A couple days before I came back home, a friend of ours took the cat to their place to babysit. But I was still feel pretty allergic and sneezing a lot, hence the allergy meds. 

- No smoking, drugs (legal or illegal) or alcohol 24 hours before surgery. Ideally, cut down or stop smoking as soon as possible prior to the day of surgery and after the surgery for at least 2 days.

**Makes sense.**

- A responsible adult must accompany the patient to the office, remain in the office during the procedure, and drive the patient home. The patient should not drive a vehicle or operate any machinery for 24 hours following the anesthesia experience.

This is fine as well, I don't really operate any heavy machinery.

- Please wear loose fitting clothing with short sleeves and low-heeled shoes – Please brush and floss your teeth the morning of surgery to minimize infection. A clean-shaven face for men is preferable before surgery. Jewelry, body piercings, and dentures must be removed at the time of surgery. No contact lenses are to be worn the day of surgery.

**Makes sense.**

- Do not wear lipstick, make-up, or nail polish on the day of surgery.

**Bummer.**

- If you have an illness such as a cold, sore throat, stomach or bowel upset, please notify the office.

I'm getting my second dose vaccine the day after, I wonder if that's going to be a problem as I may get a bit of a cold.

- At least one week prior to surgery DO NOT TAKE/DRINK: Green Tea, ginger, ginseng, garlic, and gingko biloba.

Apparently ginger increases the amount of time it takes for blood to clot, so it should be stopped before surgery. **Bummer.** 

- **NO cell phones are allowed in the OR or Recovery Room.**

Just film and apologize later is Casey Neistat's motto. 

## Operation Room

My appointment was scheduled for 7:50, but surprisingly I was actually the second appointment of the day. We waited for about half an hour and at about 8:40 they led me to a room with only a wheeled stretcher and told me to take off my shoes and glasses. The nurses spoke with me, gave me some simple instructions and also put a blanket over me as the room was a bit cold. 

Then my surgeon came in and was like "are you excited for the procedure"? I gave the honest answer, which was not really. But immediately thought about how dentists and other doctors always getting this type of negative energy, so I added I'm not too nervous and trusted his expertise.

They gave me some gas to inhale and I went under. Midway through my first breath I was thinking, what if I actually can't fall asleep. By the second breath, I was like, how many deep breaths do I need to take cause gas smell kind of weird. 

But soon enough, I fell into a dream state.

I don't remember what I was dreaming about, but the operation only lasts like 40-50 minutes so my dream felt interrupted mid plot. 

Like always, when you wake up you have this 10-30 second moment where you're like what is going on but soon enough I collected myself and realized the operation was done. I slowly find that there are a couple unfamiliar objects around me: I'm hooked up to an IV, my index finger has an oximeter on, my face is mummy wrapped with ice around my cheeks and I have a face mask on.

The surgeon gave me a couple of comforting words and then quickly left. 

Oh I forgot to say, for some wisdom teeth extractions, there is a more conservative extraction method called coronectomy. Apparently my wisdom teeth were really close to my facial (lingual and inferior alveolar) nerves, so there is small risk of nerve damage.

*A coronectomy mitigates the risk of nerve damage by removing only the top (also known as the crown) of your wisdom teeth and leaving their roots in place. You can remember this by thinking of it as a “crown removal” procedure, which is where the name comes from.*

Anyhow, I told them I wanted to just go for the full procedure where they take everything out, so when I asked them about the operation the nurses said it went well because my surgeon didn't see nerve exposure. Hopefully that meant no nerve damage.

Then the nurses told me to take 15 minutes until 9:45 before I get up because I may have a headache from the general anesthesia.

So basically they're all just waiting there, and I'm just lying on the bed in 45 degree angle trying to collect myself. I notice I can't really feel my mouth due to the sedative numbness but otherwise I feel not too terrible, probably because of the lidocaine they gave me. The back of my throat feels scratchy, apparently because of the breathing tube they gave me during procedure. I would equate it to feeling a a bit drunk and hungover as I'm slurring my words and not completely balanced when lifting myself up.

Looking at the clock it is 9:40. 10 minutes has passed and everyone is still just staring at me. 

**In true Canadian fashion, I apologize for being a little b—— for not getting up faster, cause part of me was like, oh yeah I'm fine I can do this faster than everyone else.** 

I decide to wait for the full 15 minutes before getting up and walking slowly to the chair in the other end of the room.

## Post-Operative Debrief

The nurses said that the bleeding was minimal, although when the nurse took my face mask off to check I was surprisingly bleeding a lot through my mouth (numbness made me unaware of this) so she gave me some gauze pads to stop the bleeding. Apparently I was to use those gauze pads (changing them every 30 minutes) until the bleeding was minimal. This part kind of sucks, cause you can't really talk, you're throat feels weird, but overall it is fine.

Then they basically gave me a list of instructions on what to do post procedure. I was not really ready to hear all this as I was still a bit out of it with my headache and all. 

It's like listening to a teacher while hungover. She was like:

> Okay so at 3 pm you take your ibuprofen and you take it every 6 hours. You can also take tylenol between that for pain management. Then you've got to take your antibiotics at this hour and your oral rinse the next day and the ice pack every 15 minutes and the brush with a manual toothbrush. Don't gargle, don't spit, don't suck straws... then you got to do this.. and then this..

**I'm not good with listening to instructions on a good day. I think she has to say all of this knowing that most people don't listen after just waking up because it is standard procedure.** Anyways when she finished I asked: is this written on a piece of paper? And she said "yeah". So I was good to go.

## Day 1 Post Procedure

First couple of hours the gauze pads and general headache really suck. But when I hit the 5th hour mark, the numbness around my bottom lip and cheeks were starting to go away. I drank some water, took some medication, ate some eggs and other soft foods. Started to feel a lot better after that. After I took a nap, my headache also felt much much better.

Also my family was eating noodles right in front of me, which is fine, but now I know a little bit on how Justin Kan felt when he was fasting and people were eating in front of him:

PURE TORTURE is what it is.

Midway through the first meal, I also had a sudden oh s—- moment, I felt like I was doing the same suction action as what you would do through a straw to get the food in my mouth. The reason they say not to do that is because it can dislodge the blood clot and cause dry socket, which is a common complication that causes a lot of pain many days after surgery. Basically you have to go back to clinic if that happens.

Hour 10: 

A part of me was feeling so good after the tylenol and ibuprofen that I was like f—- it lets go play some bball. 

Which is a TERRIBLE IDEA. I remember playing basketball right after I got my first dose vaccine and I was dead for the rest of the day.

Bad ideas do make great memories....

I didn't do it though. BUT the reason was because:

1. The Federer match was going on (he lost ☹️)
2. Loki episode 5 HYPE!
3. England semifinal (England won extra-time, let's goo!!!!)
4. Montreal lost... the Canadian drought continues 21 years and counting (☹️), Tampa Bay Lightning snap nine month Stanley Cup drought though. 

    One of the reddit comments was like:

    *“I’ve waited all my life to see this moment,” presumably said an eight-month-old baby who has been a Lightning fan all of his life.*

## Day 2 Post Procedure

Swelling was a lot higher but generally I felt a lot better after the first night. I was wrapping my face with ice as much as I could. Diet wise I could start biting down on some foods but I played it safe and tried to eat small but up pieces of soft chicken, rice, congee. I didn't have a headache so for the most part I was happy with my recovery.

That was until I got my second dose Moderna vaccine. Originally we were going to try to get it same day but there were no opening so I opted for the day after my wisdom teeth surgery.

We went to get the vaccine mid-afternoon. 

I felt okay for the first couple of hours post-vaccine. We even stopped by the downtown central library to take some pictures.

By the evening, it was pretty terrible.

I had a huge headache and had cold sweats.

During the middle of the night I felt really really cold and had shivers. That being said, I would say it was not the worst sickness symptoms I've ever had. 

## Day 3-4 Post Procedure

Not much change on the wisdom teeth department except that the swelling is going down a bit. Still eating lots of soft foods, but I feel that I could probably push it to a more diverse diet if I really wanted to (given that I slice everything up really well).

The vaccine hit was pretty terrible. I had a headache for both of the days so had to cancel both my Banff and Stampede plans. What made it worse was that my mouth and tongue felt kind of heavy from the sickness, which kind of exacerbated the wisdom teeth symptoms.

## Tennis and Black Widow

(I did watch the Shapovalov-Djokovic match though. Was super emotional watching Shapo cry leaving the court. He gave it his all but still missing that little bit of consistency in the big points. A very aggressive player, but probably needs a bit better shot selection and point construction. Best of luck for Djokovic today to tie Federer and Nadal for all time grand slam record of 20.)

Also watched Black Widow. Felt like a typical Marvel movie, nothing too spectacular. I was hoping they could've been more innovative in terms of a prequel that explored Hawkeye and Natasha's relationship, but the movie is set in a timeline post Civil War. I think at this point, we expect to see more in Marvel movies where they try crazier things and subvert expectations. Unfortunately, it feels like for a lot of their movies they still play it very, very safe. Hopefully in the future they'll try to be less formulaic. Particularly with more Disney+ series coming down the pipeline, I feel that it provides them room to try out more interesting things, like what they did with WandaVision.
