Okay so I've been slacking last month on the blog. I actually think there was a lot I wanted to write, to the point where it became overwhelming. Then, work got busy... insert other excuse... but anyways...

## Shang Chi Review (Spoilers)

So opening night for Shang-Chi in Canada was last Thursday. I was going to go watch with friends on Saturday.

But opening night. I was at home. I thought myself, screw it. Couldn't wait so I went and watched it.

I had watched all the trailers. I heard the early reactions of how amazing the fight sequences were. I saw clips of the amazing bus fight sequence. 

So I had high expectations for the movie, to say the least. Coming into the film, I was fairly confident that a Marvel produced film wouldn't perpetuate commonly used Asian stereotypes. However I was uncertain how detailed they would show Asian culture, particularly the family dynamics of first generation Asian American immigrants.

**Let's start with the good stuff.** 

I was glad that the opening scenes that Marvel didn't wimp out. Nearly the entire start of the movie relied on Chinese monologue with english subtitles. While this did affect the pacing of the movie, as well as "show don't tell" conventions, I applaud how gutsy of a move this was. Marvel was essentially saying from the very beginning: this is a Chinese family movie masquerading as a superhero film. Any viewers had to come along for that ride. 

That's brave.

As the movie shifted to scenes in America, I was again impressed by the detail in which they depicted Asian American families. The movie accurately reflected the messed up bilingual dialogue between Asian families where the parents speak in Chinese and the kids respond in English. They showed the weight of familial expectations on kids and how difficult it is for the children to reconcile between the conservativeness of Asian traditions and the boldness of American values. 

These details are important because it shows young Asian kids that this movie is beyond just representation of an Asian superhero. It shows them that karaoke is cool cause Shang Chi is doing it. It shows them that Asian food is cool. It shows them that many immigrant kids have their grandparents telling them to get married is actually pretty adorable and funny. Kids need these movies to show them what can be accepted in mainstream society.

For those reasons, I would love to see them dive more into the details of immigrant life in the future. I remember a friend once told me a story about how when she was little, she brought dumplings to school and was laughed at cause they didn't smell very good. When she got home she told her parents she only wanted to bring sandwiches to school and never dumplings again. Having Shang Chi doing things like eating dumplings goes a long way in not only showing Asian kids their culture is accepted, but also for other ethnicities to learn more about the culture as well.

Okay now onto some lukewarm things about the film.

To me, the movie itself was good, not great. There were many parts that were really good, and it felt like it was on the cusp of reaching something even more meaningful. But I feel like certain areas made the film feel incredibly awkward, and the Marvel formula maybe did unfortunately hold the film back. 

Needless to say, Tony Leung was incredible. His eyes do the talking. But this made the film more about setting his intentions as the villain rather than setting up the main character. Straight away, the opening action scene of the movie starts with his character taking over various kingdoms. In the subsequent scene he has a fight sequence with his future wife. So really, the early part of the movie was used to establish the villain rather than Shang Chi. 

Shang Chi gets sort of hard done by the over emphasis of the villain. We don't know much about him when we see him in the beginning as a chauffeur. So the bus scene, while well choreographed, feels a bit empty because we don't really know the character's abilities. Shang Chi's motivations feels forced. Although there are intermittent flashback scenes of his relationships with his father, there's just something missing between adult Shang Chi and Tony Leung. Maybe there's just disconnect because multiple actors are used to portray Shang Chi's younger years. Needless to say, Shang Chi's journey and motivation feel questionable to me. Shang Chi is also kind of an asshole. First, he abandons his sister and goes to America. Near the end of the movie, Shang Chi even admits he kills his mother's murderer. They gloss over this like this is acceptable for a hero, save a line from Katie saying it isn't his fault. This, coupled with the fact that Tony's acting presence is enough to overshadow most actors made it hard for me to support the main character motives in the movie. Controversial opinion, but I feel that Shang Chi as the lead was not depicted well in the movie. You saw this during Thor's first two movies as well, Loki kind of overshadows him. Hopefully in sequels Shang Chi's character gets flushed out more. 

The suspension of disbelief was also a bit sketchy in the movie. I can accept a lot of things that don't make sense cause it's a superhero film. For example, Tony Stark not getting killed after getting hit by a helicopter missile. Things like that are fine, if they are shown in an interesting and visually pleasing way. 

This film was NOT very good at this. How in the world does Katie go from a chauffeur who is a decent driver, to some type of expert arrow marksman and the second coming of Hawkeye? Wenwu jails his kids. Then somehow they get out as if it was nothing? HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS MASTERMIND WITH THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE. Also why are they jailed with Trevor? I get you wanna shoe in an audience perspective character, but it has got to make sense. Then, they get to TaLo way before Wenwu presumably so that the main character can train some BS final KO move to beat the villain. Again, I'm willing to accept most of these things because they come up a lot in superhero movies. I just don't think this time around it was done in a subtle enough way to suspend my disbelief. 

Anyways, overall I liked the film so a solid 7/10. Don't @ me.

See you guys next week!
